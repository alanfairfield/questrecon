|   Anonymous Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange MitM Vulnerability
|     State: VULNERABLE
|       Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use anonymous
|       Diffie-Hellman key exchange only provide protection against passive
|       eavesdropping, and are vulnerable to active man-in-the-middle attacks
|       which could completely compromise the confidentiality and integrity
|       of any data exchanged over the resulting session.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2015-4000  BID:74733
|       The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol contains a flaw that is
|       triggered when handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges defined with
|       the DHE_EXPORT cipher. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
|       to downgrade the security of a TLS session to 512-bit export-grade
|       cryptography, which is significantly weaker, allowing the attacker
|       to more easily break the encryption and monitor or tamper with
|       the encrypted stream.

|   Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient Group Strength
|     State: VULNERABLE
|       Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups
|       of insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly
|       shared groups, may be susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2014-3566  BID:70574
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and other
|           products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
